## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Brave, etc.) to run this tool.

### Installation

Since this is a single-file, client-side application, there's no complex installation process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Excel-Data-Filter-Report-Tool.git
    ```
    or download the `index.html` file directly.
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Excel-Data-Filter-Report-Tool
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    ```bash
    # On most systems, you can simply
    open index.html
    # or navigate to the file path in your browser's address bar:
    # file:///path/to/Excel-Data-Filter-Report-Tool/index.html
    ```
2.  The application should load, presenting you with an interface to select and load an Excel file.

---

## Usage

1.  Click the file input element (usually a button or drop area) to select an Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xls`) from your computer.
2.  Once loaded, the data from the first sheet will be displayed in a table.
3.  Use the input fields below each column header to type in text to filter the rows. Only rows containing the entered text in that column will be shown.
4.  Click the sort icons (if available, based on implementation details not fully visible) in the column headers to sort the table data by that column (ascending or descending).

*(Note: Specific UI elements and interactions depend on the full `index.html` implementation.)*
